                <p>I am from <span class="highlight">New England</span>. When I was 19 I moved to Oregon in the pursuit of 
                    knowledge. Attending Oregon Tech and University of Oregon, I graduated 
                    from UO with two degrees. continuing my pursuit of happiness, I strive
                    everyday to help generate harmony and happiness. These values are of utmost
                    importance as we live in an age of disconnection, selfishness, and greed.

                        <h2>Why Programming</h2>
                        <p class="bg-info">
                            To explain why I have chosen programming, we have to go back to the beginning.
                            Growing up my uncle was heavily involved with technology. He exposed my cousin 
                            and I at an early age and taught us to use computers. Fast forward to highschool, 
                            I essentially lived in the networking room and began to cultivate my skills with
                            database/network programming via Cisco modems. Fast forward to college, the only
                            reason I didn't choose computer science as a major is that I felt self concious
                            choosing the same major as 90% of my friends. Throughout my college years I have
                            remained connected to tech and gravitated towards CS,ENG, and MED majors. I can 
                            now say that I am happy that I have finally begun to pursue a career in tech,
                            where I have always belonged. It just took me a few years to rediscover where my
                            passions lie.
